# Research-Tracker

A place to be able to track the research papers read and add notes for each of them. Given a simple citation it parses the info and adds it into the list, with variable options for read, completed, in progress, or a reference paper. It also contains a search function to make sure a paper can be found when there are many papers in the list. The citation parser is only simple regex, so it misses some information every now and then, which can be manually added. Pagination and some other QOL functions aren't added yet, this is mostly a template for a future all in one tracking application.

The styling for this matches a [To-Do List Scheduler](https://github.com/Evan-Pochtar/Scheduler) application.
